<h2 align="center">Detailed Preparation for Two Meals</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Preparation of Jollof Rice </h3>
<p>
    The preparation of Jollof Rice starts with the Stew Base. Onions are sautéed, and a blend of pureed **Tomatoes, Pepper, Ginger, and Garlic** is added along with **Tomato Paste**. This mixture is fried down until the oil floats on top (a crucial step to remove the sourness of the tomatoes).
    Next, Stock (chicken or beef) and seasonings (Thyme, Curry Powder, Bay Leaves) are added to the stew and brought to a boil.
    The Rice is then thoroughly washed to remove excess starch, added to the boiling stew, and stirred well to ensure every grain is coated.
    The pot is covered tightly (often with foil and a lid) and allowed to steam on low heat until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. This steaming process infuses the smoky, rich stew flavor into the rice, making it a distinct "Ghana Jollof."

<h3>Preparation of Fufu and Light Soup (Nkakra) </h3>
<p>
    The preparation involves two concurrent tasks: making the fufu and preparing the soup.
</p>

<h4>Part 1: Preparing the Fufu</h4>
<p>
    Cassava and Plantain (or sometimes Yam) are peeled, boiled until tender, and drained.
    Traditionally, the boiled pieces are transferred into a large wooden mortar and pounded vigorously with a pestle until a smooth, elastic, and homogenous dough (**Fufu**) is formed. Water is occasionally added to maintain the desired consistency. The finished dough is then molded into smooth, rounded balls.
</p>

<h4>Part 2: Preparing the Light Soup (Nkakra)</h4>
<p>
    A smooth, watery stew is created. Onions, Tomatoes, and Pepper** are boiled with the Meat/Protein (e.g., goat meat). Once the meat is tender, the vegetables are removed, blended, and returned to the pot to thicken the broth.
    The soup is seasoned with just Salt (sometimes onion) and allowed to simmer until the flavors deepen. Turkey Berries** and **Garden Eggs** may be added whole for subtle flavor.
    The soup is served hot, and the Fufu is eaten by tearing off small lumps with the fingers and dipping them into the soup.
